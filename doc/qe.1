.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qemacs
is a tiny editor targetted at embedded systems or
debugging. Although it is very small, it has some very interesting
features that even big editors lack :

- Full screen editor with an Emacs look and feel with all Emacs common
features: multi-buffer, multi-window, command mode, universal
argument, keyboard macros, config file with C like syntax, minibuffer
with completion and history.

- Can edit files of hundreds of Megabytes without being slow by using
a highly optimized internal representation and by mmaping the file.

- Full UTF8 support, including bidirectional editing respecting the
Unicode bidi algorithm. Arabic and Indic scripts handling (in
progress).

- C mode: coloring with immediate update. Emacs like auto-indent.

- Shell mode: colorized VT100 emulation so that your shell work
exactly as you expect. Compile mode with next/prev error.

- Input methods for most languages, including Chinese (input methods
come from the Yudit editor).

- Hexadecimal editing mode with insertion and block commands. Unicode
hexa editing of UTF8 files also supported.

- Works on any VT100 terminals without termcap. UTF8 VT100 support
included with double width glyphs.

- X11 support. Support multiple proportionnal fonts at the same time
(as XEmacs). X Input methods supported. Xft extension supported for
anti aliased font display.
