Qi

Welcome to Qi ([pronounced 'chi'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi)).

Qi's goal is to be my perfect editor.  It attempts to combine all the things I like about _emacs_ with the speed of _vi_.   Qi focuses on the following goals:

* Speed and large file editing
* Only terminal editor (no x11, etc)
* Emacs bindings and usage emulation (chords, minibuffer, modes, etc)
* Compiles to a single, self contained binary
* Cross platform (unix based system)
* Multi-language support (with a focus on Chinese)

Qi's roots are QEmacs; Qi base is a fork or QEmacs 3.2 with a lot of bits stripped out.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Current Features

* Emacs keybindings
* Text editing mode
* Open and edit large files
* Basic C mode
* Basic Markdown mode
* Basic XML mode (and HTML)
* Hex editing mode

## Compiling

* Launch the configure tool _./configure_. You can look at the
  possible options by typing _./configure --help_.

* Type _make qi_ to compile Qi and its built-in plugins

## Documentation

The original QEmacs documentation is in _doc/qe-doc.html_; however, not all QEmacs features are in Qi and some exist that are not in the documentation.

## Licensing

QEmacs was released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (read the accompagning COPYING file) so Qi is as well.
