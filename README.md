Welcome to Qi.

Qi's goal is to be my perfect editor.  It attempts to combine all the things I like about _emacs_ with the speed of _vi_.   Qi focuses on the following goals:

* speed and large file editing
* only terminal editor (no x11, etc)
* emacs bindings and usage emulation (chords, minibuffer, modes, etc)
* compiles to a single, self contained binary
* cross platform (unix based system)

Qi's roots are QEmacs; Qi base is a fork or QEmacs 3.2 with a lot of bits stripped out.

## Current Features

* Emacs keybindings
* Text editing mode
* Open and edit large files
* basic C mode
* basic Markdown mode
* basic XML mode (and HTML)
* Hex editing mode

## Compiling

* Launch the configure tool _'./configure'_. You can look at the
  possible options by typing _'./configure --help'_.

* Type 'make qi' to compile Qi and it's built-in plugins

## Documentation

The original QEmacs documentation is in qe-doc.html; however, not all QEmacs features are in Qi and some exist that are not in the documentation.

## Licensing

QEmacs was released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (read the accompagning COPYING file) so Qi is as well.
