{"name":"Qi","tagline":"Minimalist terminal editor","body":"### Welcome to æ°” (Qi)\r\nI've tried many editors over the years, but I have never found one that fits me perfectly.  So, I decided to fork some old open source code, clean it up, build upon it, and make an editor that would be perfect for me.\r\n\r\n![qi editor][moneyshot]\r\n\r\nWhile this is blasphemy to some, I think of Qi as a combination of Emacs and Vi.  It has the usability of Emacs with the speed, small foot print and large file editing capabilities of vi.  \r\n\r\nQi is, selfishly, for me @robrohan.  You are welcome to fork, use, make suggestions, or send me questions about Qi, but I am only going to add stuff I personally want or find useful.\r\n\r\nHere are some things that make Qi Qi (or will; not everything works yet):\r\n\r\n* Emacs keybindings\r\n* Everything is UTF-8 by default (welcome to the 21st century)\r\n* Compiles into a single, standalone binary\r\n* Text and hex based editing of anything                                                                                      \r\n* Open and edit large files \r\n* Basic syntax highlighting for C, Markdown, HTML, CSS, PHP, and a few others. (Or not if you build tiny)\r\n* Simplified Chinese support (and soon input (if your terminal supports UTF-8. See second point))\r\n* Works on Mac OS X Lion and Ubuntu 12.04\r\n* Full feature compile weights in at 355K. Tiny build: 197K - smaller than most website images.\r\n* Using an SSH app, you can use Qi on a mobile device\r\n\r\n![qi on the ipad][ipad]\r\n\r\nIf you want to try Qi, you can do so in 4 nerdly easy steps\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/TheRohans/qi.git\r\n$ cd qi\r\n$ ./configure\r\n$ make qi\r\n```\r\n\r\n![random picture][dirlist]\r\n\r\nQi is forked from QEmacs by Fabrice Bellard, and is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nQi is copyright 2013 The Rohans, LLC; 2002 Fabrice Bellard.\r\n\r\n[moneyshot]: http://software.robrohan.com.s3.amazonaws.com/Qi/triwindo.png \"Tri Window with Shell\"\r\n[ipad]: http://software.robrohan.com.s3.amazonaws.com/Qi/ipad_coda.png \"On the ipad using coda\"\r\n[dirlist]: http://software.robrohan.com.s3.amazonaws.com/Qi/dired.png \"Project-ish view\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
